#### **Cryptography Algorithms Implementation**



This project contains multiple cryptography algorithms implemented in Python. It includes both basic classical encryption techniques and modern cryptographic methods. This project aims to understand how different algorithms work and how encryption, hashing, and key-based security are applied in real systems.

This work is part of my cybersecurity internship at Codec Technologies.



##### **Project Contents**



The project includes the following scripts, all written in Python:



1. Caesar Cipher – A simple classical encryption method using character shifts.
2. SHA-256 Hashing – Demonstrates secure hashing with salt using Python's hashlib.
3. AES Encryption and Decryption – A modern symmetric encryption method implemented using the PyCryptodome library.
4. RSA Encryption and Decryption – Uses public and private key pairs to encrypt and decrypt text files.



The project folder also contains sample plaintext, encrypted output files, and decrypted text generated by the code.



##### **Requirements**



The only external library required for this project is PyCryptodome.

It can be installed using:



*pip install pycryptodome*



All other modules used in the scripts are part of the standard Python library.



##### **How to Run the Scripts**



1. Caesar Cipher
   Run the script and follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt text using a shift value.
2. SHA-256 Hashing
   The script takes a sample input and generates a salted hash along with the salt used.
3. AES Encryption and Decryption
   Run the script to encrypt and decrypt text using AES in CBC mode.
   The program also generates the required key and IV.
4. RSA Encryption and Decryption

      The script offers three options through a menu:



* Generate RSA key pair
* Encrypt a text file
* Decrypt the encrypted file



The encrypted output is saved as a binary file, and the decrypted text is written back into a readable file.



##### **Learning Outcomes**



By completing this project, I learned about:



* Differences between classical and modern cryptography
* Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
* Hashing techniques and the use of salts
* File-based encryption and decryption
* Key generation and management
* Practical usage of the PyCryptodome library
* Implementing security techniques using Python
